# Min_hash_Incremental_Clustering

Cluster text data based on a combination of min_hash clustering and incremental clustering. 
By applying min_hash clustering, near duplicate text could be identified efficiently.

###  Input data:
* Each line in the input file is considered as one document to be cluseterd.
* Format: A &#& B &#& Text &#& D
* Can change the input data format and delimiter accordingly.
